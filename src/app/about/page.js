      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I was born in Nigeria and moved to Canada when I was 12. That shift across continents came with a lot of change &mdash; some exciting, some disorienting. One of the biggest things I found myself missing was the food. Not just the taste, but the culture, the feeling, the connection.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I&apos;m not a chef. But my mum, my grandma, and the women in my family are amazing cooks. Their cooking is full of flavor, history, and heart &mdash; passed down not through measurements, but through feel, intuition, and love. &quot;Just add this much&quot; or &quot;cook it until it smells right&quot; &mdash; it was never exact, but it was always perfect.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        What I&apos;ve realized is that African and Caribbean food &mdash; while different &mdash; both carry deep roots and rich traditions. But they&apos;re often underrepresented globally. Everyone knows tacos, but have they ever tried egusi soup?
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Chop</strong> is my small way of preserving, sharing, and celebrating this food. Maybe it&apos;ll just be for me &mdash; a way to hold on to memories and learn from my mum. Or maybe someone else will discover something new and fall in love with a dish they&apos;ve never had before. Either way, it&apos;s a love letter to the food that shaped me.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed italic border-l-4 border-teal-400 pl-4 text-gray-700 mt-8 mb-12">
        One day, I&apos;ll do a cook-a-thon with my mum. Document it all. Maybe finally learn to make a halfway decent imitation of the food that raised me.
