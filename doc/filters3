Recommendations for Good UX Design:
    Clear Layout: Organize filters into logical sections (e.g., Dietary Restrictions, Cooking Time, Ingredients). This makes it easier for users to understand what they can filter.
    User Feedback: Provide clear feedback when filters are applied (e.g., "You are viewing 12 recipes matching your filters").
    Predefined Options for Common Choices: Offer common filters like "Vegetarian", "Vegan", "Spicy" as default options to cater to most users.
    Accessible: Ensure that sliders, dropdowns, and checkboxes are keyboard-accessible and have screen reader support.
    Save Filter States: If possible, allow users to save their filter preferences for future sessions.
    Dynamic Filtering: Update the recipe list dynamically as filters are selected, without requiring a page reload (optional but desirable feature for smoother UX).

Considerations for the Filter Section UI:
    Placement: Place filters on the left-hand side in a collapsible panel to save space on the page. This way, the content remains easy to navigate.
    Sticky Header: For long pages or content, keep the filter panel sticky on the side, allowing users to always access filter options.
    Advanced Filtering: Add a "Show Advanced Filters" link for users who want more granular control over filters, ensuring the page remains clean for users who prefer simple options.
    Responsive Design: Ensure the filter panel is collapsible and mobile-friendly. On mobile, it might slide out from the left side or be represented by an icon (e.g., a filter icon).

This approach aims to balance powerful filtering options while maintaining an intuitive, smooth user experience. The flexibility in filtering will encourage users to explore the content without feeling overwhelmed.
