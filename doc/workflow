 Flow of Work:
    Start with Core Pages:
        Begin by working on the Home Page, including displaying some sample recipes and integrating pagination.
        Create the About Page next, as it’s simple and gives you a good starting point.

    Search Functionality:
        Once you’ve got the basic pages, implement the search bar that will allow users to search recipes. Start with basic keyword search first, then move to filters (ingredients, categories).

    Recipe Detail Page:
        After basic navigation is working, work on the Recipe Details Page with a focus on rendering detailed information and implementing the Download PDF feature.
        
    Category & Nation Pages:
        Implement Category and Nation pages, using the API to filter recipes by category/nation.

    Ingredient Selector:
        Build the Ingredient Selector Page to allow users to select ingredients and see matching recipes.

    Pagination:
        Implement pagination for search results, categories, and other lists where data could be long.

    Sitemap:
        The Sitemap Page can be a simple map or list of links.
