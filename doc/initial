OK so this is essentially supposed to be simple frotnend to show the recipes in the api. So far, I am thinking there would be an about page(what the site is for), a home page(landing page + search and filter + display some recipes right off the bat somewhere + a place to show results of searches + a button that shows categories(this would just show the list of the some categories and clicking a category which lead to a page listing all the recipes with that category) + a button to show nations(recipes are linked to nations, same idea as with categories) a recipe page(the recipe details include instructions, ingredients, time, etc. I also want a dl but that allows he user to download a 1 to 2 page pdf file for the recipe. Idk how this would work or what I need to do ), I guess another page that lists the recipes for sepcial cases liek if a user clicks a category or nation. I also have the idea that a user can select from a set of ingredients and see if any recipes can be made with it, this can be a separate page too. also finally, a simple sitemap(ik it is a simple site but It would be nice to just have a simple map to aid any navigation difficulties). also All search results or listings should be paginated(I literally realised why this is the case, because loading large amounts of data is too intensive + can overload the api/backend so we can call the api incrementally, also, the api is made to take in limit and page as query params so hopefully this can be used). 

Thats all i have for plannign so far. I dont want to just jump in(as excited as I am to do this) because I would like to have a good plan for this frotnend so it is somewhat free flowing as I work if that makes sense. can you help iron this out/build on it?
