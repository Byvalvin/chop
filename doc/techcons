Technical Considerations:
API Integration:
    Make sure you integrate the API efficiently by using:
        Pagination: Use the API’s limit and page query parameters to load data incrementally.
        Error Handling: Display appropriate error messages if the API fails or returns no data.
        Caching: If necessary, cache API responses to reduce load and speed up the app.

Frontend Architecture:
    Components: Break down your UI into reusable components to avoid repetition and increase maintainability.
        RecipeCard: A component that displays recipe details in a card format (used in Home, Category, Nation, etc.).
        Pagination: A reusable component for displaying paginated results.
        SearchBar: A reusable search component with filtering options.
        RecipeDetails: A page/component for displaying a full recipe.
        CategoryList: A component for displaying a list of categories.
        Footer: A component that handles the footer content.
    State Management:
        Use React’s state and useEffect for fetching data.
        For larger apps, consider state management libraries like Redux or Recoil for global state, though React’s built-in state is sufficient for this project.
    Styling:
        Tailwind CSS is already a great choice! It’s modular and helps you create responsive layouts quickly.
        Use CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styles, if needed.
        Create a consistent color palette and typography system for a polished and cohesive look.
    Routing:
        Next.js Pages should be used to create each route (Home, About, Recipe, Category, etc.).
        Use Next.js Link to handle navigation between pages, as it supports client-side navigation.
    SEO:
        Optimize your app for SEO using Next.js’ built-in features.
        Use <Head> from Next.js to add metadata for each page (e.g., title, description, Open Graph tags for sharing).
        Implement schema markup for recipes to help search engines understand your content better.
